# BMPtoBIN
Converts Bitmap files to binary, my usage is a 6502 emulator, I needed to extract the old Commodore64 font from a bitmap. I suppose it could work with any other image type, but I've only included bmp's, so edit it

This is a sneak peak for what is to come, I'm in the works of creating a 6502 emulator from scratch in the ever handy Javascript.

It is reccomended to use the program with 8 as your char-size, as 8 is the maximum binary length.
